# hotfrog — bugs processed by the bug loop

note: GameServer:552: attempt to index nil with 'CFrame' in createFrog, called from initPlayer
cause: FrogModel.model.json sets PrimaryPart only through Rojo's Ref attributes, which the plugin can fail to resolve on sync, so the cloned frog had a nil PrimaryPart.
change: GameServer sets frogTemplate.PrimaryPart to its Body child when unresolved, before any clone.
files: src/server/GameServer.server.luau
test: none
verified: tools/luau_check.sh clean on the file and on src/; not run in Studio
